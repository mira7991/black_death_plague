# Black death project
The Black Death project is a delivery of assignment #2 for the Programming for Social Sciences module, University of Leeds.
The main purpose of the project is to calculate the death rate from plague in London using two data sources - rats caught per week and population density per parish. The code does the multiple tasks in the following order:
1. Get web data - caught rats per 100m x 100m ^2 per week and population density per 100m x 100m ^2 per week.
2. Visualize the maps using provided data.
3. Create a function to calculate average deaths per 100m x 100m ^2 per week. It returns the output as array, visualizes as the map and saves the output if selected.
4. Calculate the average death rate  per week per 100m x 100m ^2.
5. Calculate total deaths for 16 parishes of London per week.
5. Visualize three maps simultaneously.
6. Introduce sliders to control the weights for the average number of deaths calculation.
